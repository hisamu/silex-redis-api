silex-redis-api
===============

A simple test API using Silex to handle the requests, MySQL to store the data and Redis for caching the API calls. It's supposed to be used as reference for future projects.

About the example
-----------------

This sample is a piece of a pricing API that I wrote, simplified to getting information of a `products` table and sending it as JSON through a simple API.

It also contains a very simple Silex + MySQL authentication for a backend area, wich is not implemented in the example, but may be used as a base for future implementations.
